# Git Commit Message Instructions

*Please follow these guidelines when generating commit messages:*

- Start the subject line with a type: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, etc.
- Subject should be no more than 50 characters.
- Use imperative mood in subject (e.g., "Add", "Update", not "Added", "Updated").
- Provide a concise subject that captures the essence of the change.
- In the body:
    - Use bullet points for detailed changes.
    - Each bullet should start with a verb (e.g., "Add", "Improve", "Introduce").
    - Mention specific classes or methods when relevant.
    - Be consistent with tense and voice.
